PyTorch Basics Tutorial
This repository contains code that follows the official PyTorch tutorial on the basics of PyTorch. The purpose of this project is to provide a hands-on learning experience for fundamental concepts in PyTorch, including working with Tensors, building neural networks, and understanding the training process.

üöÄ Key Topics Covered
The code is organized to mirror the sections of the tutorial, covering the following core topics:

Tensors: Understanding the basic data structure of PyTorch and how to create and manipulate them.

Datasets & DataLoaders: How to efficiently load and prepare data for model training.

Transforms: Pre-processing and augmenting data to make it suitable for a neural network.

Building a Neural Network: Defining the architecture of a simple neural network.

Autograd: An introduction to PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine, which is crucial for backpropagation.

The Optimization Loop: Implementing the core training and testing process, including forward and backward passes.

Saving & Loading the Model: How to persist a trained model and reload it for inference.
